## English -> Pig Latin Translation Rules

A word with no characters is unchanged.

* If a word begins with a vowel sound, do not shift the letters. Note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay"). Add 'way' to the end of the word.

* If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word. Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, such as the "ch" in "chair" or "st" in "stand" (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay"). If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", also move the 'u' to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay"). Add 'ay' to the end of the word.

* If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two-letter word the 'y' makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").
