# Graphs

This implements a simple graph (network) package.

## History

It was first written to support an implementation of the [Dollar Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RMmfJ_0E6Gy-R6a59mkR_donKzSNHxJq/view) so it has some vagaries more applicable to that. Examples include: the Vertex object value is an int and has Increment() and Decrement() helper functions.
